          <h3>How It Started</h3>
          <p>
            I started programming because I really liked video games, and from there I became curious about how they worked inside. What began as curiosity soon turned into a passion for building applications, video games, mechanics, and interactive experiences.

          <h3>My Training & Focus</h3>
          <p>
            I specialized in video game programming using Unity and Unreal Engine, thanks to the training I received from my professors and internship mentors, who actively used these tools. I focused on gameplay programming, virtual reality experiences, and performance-focused design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy taking complex ideas and breaking them down into something simple and scalable.

          <h3>How I Work</h3>
          <p>
            I consider myself disciplined and detail-oriented. I like to prototype ideas, test new mechanics, take mechanics and ideas from other games and make them myself, and tweak them until the system is harmonious and feels satisfying to use.
